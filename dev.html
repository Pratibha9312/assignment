            <BR><img src="..\Images\italy.jpg">
             <br><p>Italy's success as a center of modern fashion derives in large part from a uniquely Italian model of the fashion industry, quite different from that in other countries. It is immediately apparent, for example, that the family unit remains an important feature of the Italian fashion system. Craft traditions also remain strong. At the same time, the most up-to-date technology is readily available. While a handful of star designers from Milan and Rome attract public attention, hundreds of anonymous but highly trained creative talents work at family firms and large companies throughout the country. A skilled workforce is available both for factory employment and in small-scale production by independent contractors. Florence, Rome, and later Milan have all been important fashion centers, but the geography of Italian fashion is widely dispersed, and different regions of Italy specialize in different materials and goods. In addition to the regional segmentation of production in specific geographic areas known as "the Districts," the Italian fashion system is also characterized by the vertical integration of production from fiber to finished product.<br>
            <br> The Italian fashion system in the early 2000s integrates state-of-the-art production of modern apparel, relaxed tailoring, luxury leather goods and knitwear, and research into new modes of design and production together with thread, yarn, and fabric innovations. Italian style is characterized by understated luxury and modernism, as well as glamour and sensuality. Fashion designers in Italy are not considered "artists" so much as skilled workers within an industrial system. One of the dominant characteristics of the Italian fashion industry is its interdisciplinary nature: the seamless blend of product development, new materials and technology, new communications methods, celebrity, tradition, and art.<br>

            <br><img src="..\Images\france.jpg">
           
           <br><br><p>The fashion and apparel industry in France is well established and acknowledged as one of the leading fashion pioneers in the world. Despite the difficulties faced by the industry over recent years, mainly caused by the country’s economic downturn and the impact of several terror attacks and threats, France still holds its strong position in the global market and is one of the largest fashion and apparel markets in the EU when it comes to revenue.
           <br><br>According to data from the French Fashion Institute (IFM), the fashion industry in France is now worth up to €150 billion, or 2.7% of France’s GDP, and accounts for up to 1 million jobs. The revenue of the fashion industry in France amounts to over USD 13 billion a year, and it is expected to surpass USD 20 billion in 2021, representing a CAGR of over 10% from 2017 to 2021. Apparel is the largest segment of the French fashion industry in terms of sales, with a market volume of USD 8 billion in 2017.<br>
           <br>In France, womenswear is the largest category in the sector, representing over half of the overall value sales of apparel in France in 2016, while menswear accounted for just 32%. Data from Euromonitor indicates that both womenswear and menswear in France posted low growth rates in 2016, with each increasing in current value by 1%.<br>
           <br>Although the domestic market for the French fashion industry has been shrinking in recent years, the sales of French fashion products, especially luxury fashion items, still remain high in the global markets, particularly in emerging markets such as China and Japan. French luxury fashion house Christian Dior has been recently named the world’s largest apparel company due to its significant sales across the globe.<br>
           <br>As for textile and apparel production, France ranks as the third-largest in Europe, behind only Italy and Germany. France accounts for over 12% of total textile and apparel sales and 10% of the textile workforce in Europe. Over recent decades, France has also put more focus on innovative and high value-added textile products such as technical textiles, which now represent some 15% of the market. Linen is one of the most important fibres in this category, in which France now manufactures 70% of European production.<br></p>

            <img src="..\Images\usa.jfif">
            <br><br><p>The United States is one of the leading countries in the fashion design industry, along with France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy hats, boots, jeans, and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically American styles.<BR>

           <br> New York City and Los Angeles are the centers of America's fashion industry. They are considered leading fashion capitals. New York City is generally considered to be one of the "big four" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan and London.
           <br>Dress norms in the United States are generally consistent with those of post-industrial Western nations and have become largely informal since the mid-20th century. Clothing in the United States also depends on a variety of factors including location, venue, and demographic factors such as ethnicity. Jeans are a consistent fashion trend among all classes, with variations being vast in both price and style.<br>

           The western states are commonly noted for being more informal in their manner of dress than those closer to the eastern seaboard. Conspicuous consumption and a desire for quality have also led to a strong preference for designer label clothing among many in the middle and upper classes.
